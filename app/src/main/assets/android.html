<p><b>Android</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system" title="Mobile operating system">mobile operating system</a> (OS) currently developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a>, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel" title="Linux kernel">Linux kernel</a> and designed primarily for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen" title="Touchscreen">touchscreen</a> mobile devices such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone" title="Smartphone">smartphones</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer" title="Tablet computer">tablets</a>. Android's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface" title="User interface">user interface</a> is mainly based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_manipulation_interface" title="Direct manipulation interface">direct manipulation</a>, using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_keyboard" title="Virtual keyboard">virtual keyboard</a> for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_TV" title="Android TV">Android TV</a> for televisions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Auto" title="Android Auto">Android Auto</a> for cars, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Wear" title="Android Wear">Android Wear</a> for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop" title="Laptop">notebooks</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console" title="Video game console">game consoles</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera" title="Digital camera">digital cameras</a>, and other electronics. As of 2015, Android has the largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installed_base" title="Installed base">installed base</a> of all operating systems.</p>
<p>Initially developed by Android, Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, along with the founding of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance" title="Open Handset Alliance">Open Handset Alliance</a> a consortium of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software" title="Software">software</a>, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard" title="Open standard">open standards</a> for mobile devices. As of July 2013, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play" title="Google Play">Google Play</a> store has had over one million Android applications ("apps") published, and over 50 billion applications downloaded. An Aprilâ€“May 2013 survey of mobile application developers found that 71% of developers create applications for Android, and a 2015 survey found that 40% of full-time professional developers see Android as their priority target platform, which is comparable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." title="Apple Inc.">Apple</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" title="IOS">iOS</a> on 37% with both platforms far above others. At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O" title="Google I/O">Google I/O</a> 2014, the company revealed that there were over one billion active monthly Android users, up from 538 million in June 2013.</p>
<p>Android's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code" title="Source code">source code</a> is released by Google under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="Open source">open source</a> licenses, although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services. Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-tech" title="High-tech" class="mw-redirect">high-tech</a> devices. Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. At the same time, as Android has no centralised update system most Android devices fail to receive security updates: research in 2015 concluded that almost 90% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. The success of Android has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone_wars" title="Smartphone wars" class="mw-redirect">smartphone wars</a>" between technology companies.</p>
